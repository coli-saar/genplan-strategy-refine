Now write a short description of the following specific problem instance of the domain. The description should be easy to read for people who do not know any PDDL. It should consist of natural language, but it does not need to be a paragraph of text. You can structure the description such that it is easy to process, e.g. you can express (parts of) the initial state in an ascii-like representation.

{% if plan_str %} Additionally, provide a description of the presented example solution plan. {% endif %}

"""
Problem instance:
{{ problem_str }}

{%- if plan_str %}

Plan:
{{ plan_str }}
{%- endif %}
"""

Please provide the problem description in the following format:
"""
Problem description:
[YOUR DESCRIPTION]
"""
{% if plan_str %}

Please provide the description of the solution in the following format:
"""
Plan description:
[YOUR DESCRIPTION]
"""
{% endif %}

Make sure that the problem description mentions all objects that are part of the problem instance.
Do not include anything else than the description itself between the quotation marks.
