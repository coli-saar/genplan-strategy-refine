Now, please provide the adapted version of the python code that fixes the mistake.

You can think step-by-step and include your reasoning for deriving at the adapted code. But at the end of your response, provide only the final python code in the following format:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Set
def generate_solution(objects: {{ object_type_str }}, init: Set[Tuple], goal: Set[Tuple]) -> List[str]:
# Your code here
return solution
```

Remember:
Only include the code for the main function and any required helper functions. Do NOT include any examples or actual calls of the function.
You cannot use any external libraries or modules.
