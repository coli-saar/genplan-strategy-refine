You are a brilliant assistant for generating python code that is able to solve all instances of a game.

Here is the description of how the game works:
"""
{{ domain_descript }}
"""

Here is a strategy for solving individual task instances of the game.
"""
{{ strategy }}
"""

I want to implement the strategy as a Python function that does not use any search.

The main function should be of the form
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Set
def generate_solution(objects: {{ object_type_str }}, init: Set[Tuple], goal: Set[Tuple]) -> List[str]:
# Your code here
return solution
```

Input restrictions:
- {{ object_input }}
- `init` is a set of the facts that are true in the initial state and that are represented as tuples of fact names and the objects to which it applies (e.g., ('fact_1', 'object_1', ...))
- `goal` is the set of goal facts represented in the same way
The possible facts for the initial and goal state are:
{{ predicate_hint }}

Output restrictions:
- `solution` is a list of actions that transform the initial state into the goal. Each action is represented as a string (e.g. ['(action_1 object_1)', '(action_2 object2 object 3)', ...])
The valid actions are:
{{ action_hint }}
where tokens starting with '?' are placeholders for the actual objects.

{% if single %}Here is one example:{% else %}Here are some examples:{% endif %}
{% for ex in examples%}
{{ ex }}

{% endfor %}

Please provide me the python code for the strategy.
Only include the code for the main function and any required helper functions. Do NOT include any examples or actual calls of the function.
You cannot use any external libraries or modules.
