You are a brilliant assistant for helping people who are trying to come up with a plan for solving a task instance from a game. There exists a strategy that needs to be followed to reach the goal.

Here is the description of how the game works:
"""
Description of the game:
{{ domain_descrip }}
"""

Here is the strategy for solving the game that should be followed to derive the goal:
"""
Strategy:
{{ domain_strategy }}
"""

And here is the description of the task instance that needs to be solved:
"""
Task description:
{{ problem_descrip }}
"""

{%- if problem_pddl %}
And this is the formal definition of the task instance in the PDDL language:
"""
{{ problem_pddl }}
"""
{% endif -%}

Please provide the solution derived by applying the strategy to the task instance.
Follow the strategy step-by-step. Provide the solution in the following format:
"""
Solution:
(action_1)
(action_2)
...
(action_X)
"""

where valid actions are:
{{ action_hint }}

If the goal is already satisfied and no actions are required then reply with:
"""
Solution:
